A CHIP-8 implementation in Rust.

The core COSMAC VIP features are implemented as faithfully as I could, with some modern behaviors gated behind the `modern` feature.

Passes the first four tests of [Timendus' test suite](https://github.com/Timendus/chip8-test-suite/). 

Bevy frontend is still WIP.
